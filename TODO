Tumbler TODO List
=================

  - convenience function in tumbler/tumbler-thumbnail.{c,h} to save 
    pixbufs with thumbnail attributes, see
     
      http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/creation.html 
    
    for more info.

  - create thumbnails (and directories) with the correct chmod bits set.

  - make it possible for thumbnailer plugins to notify the registry
    that their supported URI schemes and MIME types have changed (this
    is required for the ThunarVFS thumbnailer plugin to work).
